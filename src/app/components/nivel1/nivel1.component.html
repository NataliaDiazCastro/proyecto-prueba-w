    <h4 style="color: #015883;">How can I structure the body of the literature review?</h4>

            Depending on the length of the review and on its purposes, you can organize your literature review using
            different approaches. You can choose one of the following methodologies or you can combine them but
            congruently.

                    <strong>Chronological or historical approach:</strong> &nbsp;review within a period of time.

                <div class="accordion-body" style="text-align: justify;">
                    This methodology is about tracing the development of the topics or theories over time. You need to
                    explain and interpret this development by analyzing patterns, turning points and key debates that
                    have shaped the direction of the field. <br><br>
                    For the review, it is important to set a starting date, year or period and justify the choice of
                    this period. <br><br>

                    This chronological approach is related to a historical one since it focuses on examining research
                    throughout a period of time, often starting with the first time an issue, concept, theory, phenomena
                    emerged in the literature, then tracing its evolution within the scholarship of a discipline. The
                    purpose is to place research in a historical context to show familiarity with state-of-the-art
                    developments and to identify the likely directions for future research.

                    With this methodology, you can organize the literature review into several subsections to address
                    the different themes, concepts and aspects of your topics, but you have to be careful not to just
                    make a list of themes; the presentation of the research must respond to an organizational pattern in
                    order to attain connections.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The thematic approach can also be developed along with the chronological approach to account for the
                    progression of time of the different themes.

                    A literature review can also emphasize the methods or procedures that the different research studies
                    implemented to obtain and analyze data, as well as to state the final findings. This means that the
                    review cares more about how the researchers came about stating the findings more than the findings
                    themselves, unlike the thematic approach, which emphasizes more the results.
                    <br><br>
                    Reviewing methods of analysis provides a framework of understanding at different levels, for
                    example, qualitative and quantitative approaches, empirical and scientific research, ethnographic
                    and experimental research, etc.

                    mean the theoretical framework for your research to the extent that it helps to establish what
